* Redefine Riot-independent #define constants using "static const" and "static inline".

* Change m_pthread->flags directly instead calling thread_flags_set(), if we don't need to yield to other threads at this moment, and there is no other threads or interrupt that can change it simultaneously (So irq_disable() is not necessary).

* Fix: "CDCACM: line coding not supported".

[Refactor]
* Rename reboot_to_bootloader -> jump_to_bootloader in board-dropalt, Lua and bootloader.
* Rename .value -> .uint?. Search for "union" across sources.
* Rename key_queue -> main_key_events, key_event_queue_t -> usb_key_events.
* `assert( false )` and `assert( status == LUA_OK )` are not the proper way to shutdown. Use abort(), lua_error() or luaL_error() instead.
  `assert()` for only "non-trivial" logical error.

[ADC]
* Simultaneous measurements for ADC0 and ADC1. `state_determine_host` can improve its scanning algorithm.
* Adjustable threshold values (ADC_CON1_NOMINAL) in NVM?

[Keymap]
* Context-remembering keymaps:
  Pressing End the first time triggers End, then triggers Home on the 2nd and 3rd
  presses. Can be implemented using TapSeq with a longer tapping_term_ms.

[Swithcover]
* Configure the automatic switchover feature in config.hpp.

[RGB]
* Precise color accuracy isn't necessary â€” keycaps show everything in a reddish color.

* Tips
  - `typedef struct lua_State lua_State;`
  - CFLAGS from parent Makefile are inherited, but the changes in child Makefiles do not propagate back.
  - Use likely(x) (== __builtin_expect((uintptr_t)(x), 1)) if appropriate.
  - Allocate variables in ".noinit" section (NOINIT) unless initialization is strictly necessary.
  - Favor fputs() over printf() and puts() if possible to minimize code size.
  - Don't waste assert(). Even a simple `assert( m_pthread );` consumes 56 bytes.
  - Don't include <cstdbool>, <cstddef> and <cstdint> for each source file, as they would
    have been already included in the header file that provides the functions with those
    types as parameters or as a return value.
  - Binary size is also affected by .data section. Walk through those variables that initialize with non-zero values.

[Log]
* LOG_DEBUG() and fw.log() add '\n' automatically at the end.
* Replace printf() with cout, calling usbus_cdc_acm_flush() when '\n' is hit. LOG_*() can also be implemented using an ostream.
* Store a format string and its parameters for a log record.
  All parameters will be 4 bytes in size, except for doubles.
  Consider Default Argument Promotion Rules for variadic functions in C/C++.

* Use MODULE_CORE_IDLE_THREAD to enable CPU sleep when idle.

[Bootloader Updater]
* Headerless application
* E.g. `make riotboot/slot0` generates two binaries: one with a header and one without.
* Generic updater that does not setup EEPROM.
* Provides slot 0 in dfu-util to flash the real bootloader (at the first 16KB).
* Allocate and initialize SEEPROM, or hardfault will occur otherwise.
* Maybe we could utilize an intermediary bootloader to flash the final bootloader, using memory banks and switching them.

[Bootloader]
* Bootloader as a shared library
  The bootloader, rather than the firmware, could function as a shared library (.so) because it undergoes fewer changes. This shared library could potentially allocate a reset vector at address 0. Additionally, symbols exported from the bootloader might be able to resolve those in the firmware.
* Implement the firmware uploading feature
  Currently, we can retrieve the logs stored in the device's backup ram using the upload command of `dfu-util`. While also uploading a firmware binary is not essential, it is still a nice feature to have. The implementation would be straightforward, but we need to determine the image size beforehand. This can be pre-written when generating a firmware image with the slot header included (`slot0.XXXX.bin`). We could consider extending riotboot_hdr_t in riot/sys/include/riotboot/hdr.h..."

[Keymap recovery]
* Default keymaps are stored in a byte array in the firmware so that it is selected when a "custom" keymaps at flash slot 1 fails to load (or run).

* Where will be the UART pins?
