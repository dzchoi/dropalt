#### Using TLSF for dynamic memory allocation.

The TLSF (Two-Level Segregated Fit) memory allocator is designed for real-time systems and embedded environments where predictable and efficient memory management is critical. Here are its key features:

* Constant-Time Allocation and Deallocation:  
TLSF provides O(1) time complexity for both allocation and deallocation operations, ensuring consistent and predictable performance, which is essential for real-time systems.

* Low Fragmentation:  
TLSF effectively minimizes memory fragmentation by segregating memory into different size classes, making it highly efficient in managing memory blocks of various sizes.

* Real-Time Suitability:  
With its constant-time operations and low fragmentation, TLSF is well-suited for real-time and embedded systems where deterministic behavior is crucial.

* Efficient Memory Utilization:  
TLSF uses a two-level segregated fit strategy, which combines the benefits of fast-fit allocation (for small blocks) and segregated free lists (for larger blocks). This ensures efficient memory utilization and reduces waste.

* Low Overhead:  
The allocator has minimal overhead, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments where every byte of memory counts.

* Thread Safety:  
Although TLSF itself is not inherently thread-safe, it can be combined with synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutexes) to ensure safe memory allocation in multi-threaded environments.
